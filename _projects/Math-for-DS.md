##### **Next Speaker:** [**Jim Dai**](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/), Cornell University
##### **Date/Time:** Friday, September 25th, 11am EDT [**[Zoom Link]**](https://psu.zoom.us/j/95512102924)
##### **Title:** Queueing Network Controls via Deep Reinforcement Learning

**Abstract:** Conservative update methods such as Trust Region policy optimization and Proximal policy optimization (PPO) have become the dominant reinforcement learning algorithms because of their ease of implementation and good practical performance. A conventional setup for notoriously difficult queueing network control problems is a Markov decision problem (MDP) that has three features: infinite state space, unbounded costs, and long-run average cost objective. We extend the theoretical framework of these conservative update methods for such MDP problems. The resulting PPO algorithm is tested on a parallel-server system and large-size multiclass queueing networks. The algorithm consistently generates control policies that outperform state-of-art heuristics in literature in a variety of load conditions from light to heavy traffic. These policies are demonstrated to be near-optimal when the optimal policy can be computed.  A key to the successes of our PPO algorithm is the use of three variance reduction techniques in estimating the relative value function via sampling. First, we use a discounted relative value function as an approximation of the relative value function. Second, we propose regenerative simulation to estimate the discounted relative value function. Finally, we incorporate the approximating martingale-process method into the regenerative estimator. This is joint work with Mark Gluzman at Cornell.

**Bio:** Jim Dai is  the Leon C. Welch Professor of Engineering in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University. He is also a Presidential Chair Professor in the School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Prior joining Cornell, he held the Chandler Family Chair of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, where he was a faculty member from 1990 to 2012. Dai studies applied probability models for efficient resource allocations in stochastic processing networks that model a variety of engineered and service systems including customer contact centers, data centers, hospital patient flow, and ridesharing networks.

 Dai received his BA and MA in mathematics from Nanjing University and his PhD in mathematics from Stanford. He received the Erlang Prize in 1998 from the Applied Probability Society (APS) of INFORMS. He also received two Best Publication Awards from APS, one in 1997 and one in 2017. In 2018, he received The Achievement Award from  ACM SIGMETRICS. Dai served as the Editor-In-Chief of Mathematics of Operations Research from 2012 to 2018. He is a fellow of INFORMS and the Institute for Mathematical Statistics.
