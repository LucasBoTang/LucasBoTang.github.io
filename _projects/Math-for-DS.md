##### **Title:** Stress Minimization for Low-Diameter Graphs

**Abstract:**  Stress Majorization is a popular tool for visualizing high dimensional data and large networks. There exists a number of different heuristics to approximately minimize the stress of a graph, most notably the SMACOF algorithm and the Kamada-Kawai algorithm. In this talk we investigate the optimization problem in question, produce algorithmic lower bounds, and provide a polynomial time approximation scheme for low diameter graphs.
