##### **Title:** Policy Optimization for Linear Optimal Control with Guarantees of Robustness 

**Abstract:** Policy optimization (PO) is a key ingredient of modern reinforcement learning (RL), and can be used for the efficient design of optimal controllers. For control design, certain constraints are generally enforced on the policies to be implemented, such as stability, robustness, and/or safety concerns on the closed-loop system. Hence, PO entails, by its nature, a constrained optimization in most cases, which is also nonconvex, and analysis of its global convergence is generally very challenging. Further, another element that compounds the challenge is that some of the constraints that are safety-critical, such as closed-loop stability or the H-infinity norm constraint that guarantees the system robustness, can be difficult to enforce on the controller while being learned as the PO methods proceed. We have recently overcome this difficulty for a special class of such problems, which I will discuss in this presentation.

Specifically, I will introduce the problem of PO for H2 linear control with a guarantee of robustness according to the H∞ criterion, for both continuous- and discrete-time linear systems. I will argue, with justification, that despite the nonconvexity of the problem, PO methods can enjoy the global convergence property. More importantly, I will show that the iterates of two specific PO methods (namely, natural policy gradient and Gauss-Newton) automatically preserve the H∞ norm (i.e., the robustness) during iterations, thus enjoying what we refer to as “implicit regularization” property. Furthermore, under certain conditions, convergence to the globally optimal policies features globally sub-linear and locally super-linear rates. Due to the inherent equivalence of this optimal robust control model to risk-sensitive linear control and linear quadratic (LQ) dynamic games, these results also apply as a byproduct to these settings as well, which I will also discuss. The talk will conclude with some informative simulations, and brief discussion of extensions to the model-free framework and associated sample complexity analyses.
